"""
Here is my first programming.

1. python is an interpreter language, and it's execute the code line by line and send to the processor to execute the
each line.

2. python was a dynamic type language like javaScript here also don't need to declare the data-type for each
variable declaration.

3. In python you have to declare the multiple variable in single line
ex: name, age, value = "siva", 27, 95.7;

4. In python if ypu want to print he values repeatedly as much as you want just using the multiplication
ex: print("siva" * 10);

"""

print("Hello")
